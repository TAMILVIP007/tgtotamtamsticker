A is a bot that converts Telegram stickers to TamTam format and helps to upload them to TamTam.

Everything is done quickly, in a few clicks.
All your favorite sticker packs from Telegram are now in TamTam!

## Short instruction:

1) Send the name of the sticker pack from Telegram:

    *The name of the sticker pack can be obtained by rummaging through the pack in any chat, for example, in your "Saved messages". You will get a link like this:[https://t.me/addstickers/RickAndMorty](https://t.me/addstickers/RickAndMorty)*

   *The name of the pack in this case is* ***RickAndMorty***

2) The bot will send the archive(s) with stickers in the required format, save them.

3) Send them to the official TamTam bot to add stickers: [@stickers](https://tt.me/stickers)

4) Follow the instructions from the [@stickers](https://tt.me/stickers) bot something like this: new pack -> set name -> send our archive(s). If there are several archives, we wait until the previous one is processed (the bot will write that it added stickers) and send the next one.

5) Done 🎉.
